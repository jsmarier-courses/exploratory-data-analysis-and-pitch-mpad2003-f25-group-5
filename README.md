Using the Long Form 2021 Census Ward Data from Open Ottawa (collected by the Government of Canada with a 25% sample size), we conducted an exploratory data analysis. The data provides insight into many different aspects of the lives of Ottawans. We chose to look into the Deaf community of Ottawa by looking at the data pertaining to the various ways Ottawans use sign languages in their lives. We identified pockets of higher populations of signers in specific wards across the city, allowing us to begin understanding the geographical makeup of signers and/or the Deaf community in Ottawa.
